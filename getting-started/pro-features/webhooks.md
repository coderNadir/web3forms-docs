# Webhooks

Webhooks can be a great way to connect your form to other apps via Zapier or Integromat. The possibilites are limitless.&#x20;

Using Webhooks, you can transform the data you received to your favorite CRM or Email Newsletter Provider. Or you can create Notifications & Alerts on Slack or Telegram. And you can also transfrom the data to the plain good ol' google sheets.&#x20;

Its up to you how you want to transform the data. Everything is possible just by adding your webhook URL to the form.&#x20;

### Creating Webhooks URL

Webhook URL can be created on apps like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) or [Make](https://www.make.com/) or [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/). We recommend Pipedream if you are technical because it has a good free plan to try out webhooks.&#x20;

### Adding Webhooks to your form

Just add the following line inside your `<form>` and make sure the change the `value=""` with your actual webhook URL from your app.&#x20;

```markup
<input type="hidden" name="webhook" value="WEBHOOK_URL_HERE" />
```

### Webhook Payload Structure

We will be sending the same data you sent to Web3Forms as `body` to your webhook URL. However, will also delete some metadata such as `access_key` & attachments before we send.&#x20;
