# Restrict to Domain

Heads Up! This is a PRO feature. You must have an active membership to use this feature.
{% endhint %}

You can restrict the form from sending only through a whitelisted domain. This will potentially reduce spam attacks. So even if someone else got the access key, they cannot send emails to you. Only emails from your website are counted.
